                  Education is a vital instrument for social change. The factors
                  that warrant social change are not static and assume diverse
                  dimensions in&nbsp;different directions. A social change in a
                  right direction depends on the strength and character of the
                  men who constitute the society The&nbsp;contemporary children
                  and youth in different age groups could be the potential
                  members of the tomorrow's society However they need to be
                  handled and shaped suitably which is possible only through
                  quality education. It is in this context that "Swami
                  Vivekananda emphasized&nbsp;on the need of life-building,
